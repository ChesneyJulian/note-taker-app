# note-taker-app
## Description
The goal of this project was to create a functional server for pre-existing front end code to create a note taking application. This project utilizes JavaScript and Express.js to allow users to create notes, read notes, and delete notes. The notes themselves are transferred and saved to a db.json file in the db folder of the root directory of the application. The server for this app functions with GET, POST, and DELETE requests.
